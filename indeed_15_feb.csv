Neustar is looking for talented marketing strategy analysts with excellent quantitative and analytical skills. Our ideal candidates are determined to combine the art and science of analytics and marketing to help clients address the complex challenges of marketing effectiveness, ROI, brand equity impact, channel effectiveness, and pricing.

In the Associate Advisory Services Consultant role, you’ll support senior strategists on multi-million dollar customer engagements. You’ll build your network with the top marketing leadership in major companies across virtually all industries. You’ll work hands on with quantitative marketing data to analyze and reveal the business drivers of the Fortune 500. You will develop expertise at the intersection of big data, marketing, and consulting. Our work is not just about delivering a project and moving on to the next challenge. Instead, it’s about delivering an evolving stream of value and enabling fact-based decision making.

What you will be doing:
You’ll be on the team that is the face of the company, the customer's go-to person who delivers on the promise of Neustar.
You’ll help diagnose business needs, translate into questions that Neustar will answer, and architect ways to wrangle data from multiple sources.
You’ll work closely with Neustar’s modeling team and other strategists to identify new insights, and translate findings into insights and stories that create ‘ah ha’ moments for customers.
You’ll help bridge between the builders of sophisticated quant models and people who run screaming from numbers.
You’ll learn to translate our analytics into the stakeholder’s native language and tell stories to make complex things simple to understand and translate into measurable actions.
Your data analytics diligence will help ensure that customers get the full benefit of Neustar’s software and accompanying strategic advice.

0-1 years’ experience in marketing analytics strategy or marketing consulting. Client facing experience also helpful.
Exceptional analytics and quantitative acumen with understanding of marketing mix models or close experience such as predictive analytics.
Ideal if you have specific experience in the ad-tech industry, a digital marketing agency, a programmatic buying company or client side digital advertising.
You are well versed in data and have no problem calling BS, telling truth to power when data looks wonky. You might even have measurement experience across multiple channels, and your passion is for data sources that are real time and audience addressable.
Definite advanced proficiency with software tools such as Excel to gather, assess, and analyze data as well as PowerPoint to build presentations.
Resilient work ethic with the capability to adapt to the situation, flexibility and nimbleness in terms of work planning, and the ability to think quickly on your feet.

Working professionals and adult learners can enhance their careers and/or enrich their intellect through more than 1,500 noncredit courses, certificates, and diploma programs, as well as through world-renowned industry conferences, seminars, and events.
The Schack Institute of Real Estate was founded in 1967 at the initiative of prominent members of the New York City real estate community.

Write and test code to create the catalog and to integrate it with other tools in the environment
Help ensure that the catalog contains high quality information about data assets available for consumption
Assist with the rollout and deployment of the catalog
Collaborate on the underlying technology architecture for the data catalog

----------------



In 2009, Accordion set out to prove that there was a better way to work in finance – and more specifically, a better way to unlock value potential in private equity portfolio companies. In the years since, our firm has grown into a bi-coastal team of 100+ finance and technology professionals, serving nearly 200 of the world's leading private equity firms out of offices in New York, San Francisco, and Boston.



Our mission is to shape a new era in the private equity industry. Focusing exclusively on the office of the CFO of PE-backed companies, we're committed to driving value creation through financial consulting services and portfolio operations technology.



So, what does it mean to work at Accordion? It means thriving in a high-growth, agile, and collaborative environment. It means changing the way private equity firms create value at their portfolio companies. And ultimately, it means making your mark on the firm's future – by embracing a culture rooted in humility and a firm-wide commitment to building something great, together.



You are

-------




Passionate about delivering exceptional service to clients
Excessively detailed oriented
A self-starter with a strong work ethic
Able to work independently and as part of a team as needed
Ability to work seamlessly across a multitude of client cultures
Willing to travel according to client needs

You have

--------

What you'll do

--------------------



As part of a lean, cross-functional team, the Associate will play a vital role in identifying and rectifying issues across a broad range of scenarios. The following representative engagements are emblematic of the type of work you'll do as an Associate at Accordion:




A rapidly growing company with a global footprint routinely takes 45 days to close its books and produce financial statements. You are brought in to:
Perform deep-dives and gain an understanding of current state processes, people, and systems (both on paper and in reality).
Identify root causes and provide recommendations on how to improve broken processes, bridge control gaps, and better align roles and responsibilities with best practices.
Implement tools and creative solutions that the accounting function can use to streamline their close process (e.g. introduce materiality limits, close checklists, and calendars).
In order to keep pace with its competitors, a technology company is looking to move away from a traditional subscription-based model to a SaaS model, and requires guidance in dealing with the key finance and accounting implications which will ensue. You are part of a team that will:
Address changes in revenue recognition requirements and draft accounting policies that affirm the new normal.
Challenge existing assumptions in underlying revenue forecasts and associated cost-drivers.
Evolve the invoicing process to reflect new business processes.
Following the acquisition of three similar, stand-alone businesses, a PE Sponsor has identified the need to consolidate operations in order to realize the synergies identified in their investment thesis. Get ready to:
Design a singular finance function that can serve all three businesses; you'll put together intuitive processes and controls, and realign roles and responsibilities to suit the strengths of the individuals.
Draft a unified set of policies and procedures that speak to all three businesses and encourages them to operate with consistency.
Select, implement, and champion a robust ERP solution which meets the needs of the combined business.
Consolidate their existing financial reporting from disparate systems, including adjusting for deviations in accounting policies and procedures, to produce a single source of numerical truth.

What you'll need

Founded in 1964, Alger is widely recognized as a pioneer of growth-style investment management. Headquartered in New York City with affiliate offices in Boston and London, Alger provides U.S. and non-U.S. institutional investors and financial advisors access to a suite of growth equity separate accounts, mutual funds, and privately offered investment vehicles. The firm’s investment philosophy, discovering companies undergoing Positive Dynamic Change, has been in place for over 50 years.

Alger’s Investment Team is the engine that drives the Firm’s strong long-term investment returns of our portfolio strategies and success for our clients. Our investment strategies range from U.S. small cap to large cap stocks and International and Emerging Markets growth stocks, in both traditional long-only and long/short hedged equity portfolios.
