We work with healthy companies that have strong management teams, where we can act as true partners with a shared goal: accelerating potential by removing capital constraints. The executives we invest in are experts in their fields and have built excellent businesses, and as such, we seek to support management's goals without imposing undue cultural change.

You will build long term relationships with the management teams and can expect to be on site as needed during most integrations.

Responsibilities:

As an Associate, Merger Integration you will work with Dorilton's Operations team in conjunction with portfolio company personnel from CEO to staff to identify, design, implement, and maintain cost saving and revenue increasing opportunities as well as support all ongoing integration planning and efforts.
Some of the areas of opportunity you will most likely see include: due diligence, modelling, planning processes, synergy tracking, cost analysis, KPI and goal integration, procurement, technology integration, organizational design, and more.
Your analytical, interpersonal, out-of-the-box thinking, and problem-solving skills will be exercised starting from day one.
